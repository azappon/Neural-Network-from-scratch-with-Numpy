# Neural Network from scratch with Numpy
Built a simple three-layered (input-hidden-output) NN without using classic libraries such as Keras/Tensorflow/JAX/PyTorch, but instead working with Numpy arrays. Obtained an overall decent accuracy on the MNIST dataset. 
To use the MNIST dataset you can either access it from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer or use libraries such as keras.datasets or python-mnist.
